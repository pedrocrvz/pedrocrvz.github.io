My name is Pedro and currently I am studying at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon. <br>
I'm taking my Master Degree in Engineering Systems and Computer Engineering with focus on cyber-security. I'm on my last year and I'm writing my thesis about static analysis of smart contracts, with focus on Ethereum contracts written in Solidity. <br>
I'm most interested in web development, security and blockchain technology. <br>
I love traveling and discovering new cultures and persons, as well as facing new challenges. I'm curious, ambitious and open-minded. <br>
If you would like to discuss anything or get in touch with me, you can contact me by email.<br>
